#Test Container

Testcontainers: Key Benefits and Issues Addressed

    Static Integration Infrastructure Issues
        Shared test environments can cause conflicts, e.g., one pipeline inserts data while another deletes it, leading to inconsistent test results and failures.

    Real Dependency Testing
        Testcontainers allow testing with real dependencies (e.g., actual databases) instead of in-memory alternatives, ensuring more accurate test results.

    Consistency Across Local and CI
        Provides the same developer experience locally and in CI pipelines, eliminating environment discrepancies.
