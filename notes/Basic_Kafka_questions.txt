What happens if the consumer crashes after reading a message but before processing it?

How do you ensure ordered processing of messages in Kafka?

You need to scale Kafka consumers dynamically. How do you approach this?

What are the best strategies to prevent bottlenecks in Kafka load balancing

How does self-balancing clusters improve Kafka load management automatically
What are the trade-offs of increasing partitions on Kafka cluster load and throughput
Kafka Scenario: 50,000 Producer Messages and Only One Consumer

🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting
Your Kafka consumers are seeing high message lag. How would you troubleshoot the issue?

What metrics would you look at?

How do you differentiate between slow consumers and broker performance?

You notice increased latency in Kafka message delivery. What are the possible causes and how do you identify the root cause?

A Kafka topic has a growing number of partitions. Suddenly, producers start to fail or throw exceptions. What could be causing this?

A Kafka broker goes down frequently during high throughput. How do you analyze the broker logs and JVM heap to find memory or GC-related issues?

You see a NotEnoughReplicasException error in your logs. What does this mean, and how should you respond?

🛠️ Kafka Configuration & Tuning
What configurations would you modify to tune Kafka for low-latency, high-throughput use cases like real-time analytics or log processing?

How do producer settings like acks, linger.ms, and batch.size impact performance and delivery guarantees?

How would you configure Kafka to support compacted topics for streams that only care about the latest state per key?

What’s the impact of increasing num.partitions for a topic used by multiple consumer groups? Can it lead to any issues?

📦 Data Consistency & Delivery Guarantees
How do you achieve exactly-once delivery across Kafka and a downstream database like PostgreSQL using Kafka Streams or Kafka Connect?

What is the impact of enabling Kafka’s idempotent producer and transactional writes? What problems does it solve, and what new constraints are introduced?

If a consumer crashes just after consuming a message but before committing the offset, what happens? How does Kafka handle this by default?

🌐 Distributed Setup & Operations
How would you replicate Kafka topics across multiple data centers for DR (Disaster Recovery)? What tools or configurations would you use?

Describe how to perform a rolling upgrade of a Kafka cluster with minimal downtime and no data loss.

How do you deal with network partitions or Zookeeper flapping in a Kafka cluster? How does it impact brokers and throughput?

🌪 Real-World Design Scenarios
How would you design a Kafka-based system to stream millions of IoT sensor data updates per second to a real-time dashboard with sub-second latency?

How would you handle schema evolution in a Kafka + Schema Registry setup, if multiple consumers use different versions of the schema?

You need to ingest clickstream traffic from multiple countries with low latency. How do you design Kafka clusters and topics to handle multi-region latency and failover?

How can Kafka be integrated with Kubernetes or managed on cloud platforms like AWS/GCP/Azure for scalable event-driven architecture?

📊 Kafka Metrics & Observability
Which Kafka metrics (JMX or Prometheus) do you monitor in real-time to ensure the health of producers, brokers, and consumers?

How can lag between producer send and consumer receive be accurately measured in real-time? Can Kafka support historical lag analysis?

🔐 Security & Governance
How do you implement per-topic ACLs in Kafka for multi-tenant clusters? What are best practices for managing Kafka security in production?

Your organization must meet audit requirements. How do you ensure Kafka logs all access and data changes for compliance?

Bonus 🎯
Kafka log segments are not getting deleted even though the retention period is expired. Why?

(Check segment size, active producer, or log cleaner status.)

What Kafka component would you use to sync data from PostgreSQL to Kafka in near-real-time? What are the challenges with Change-Data-Capture (CDC)?

Would you like these questions with sample answers, or do you want me to create a mini Kafka real-time diagnostic quiz or case study to test your skills interactively?

Advanced Apache Kafka Questions
💾 Kafka Internals and Architecture:
What are the key trade-offs between a high replication factor and throughput in Kafka? How would you balance them in a production system?

How does Kafka ensure ordering at the partition level, and what factors can break the order guarantee?

Explain the role of the ISR (In-Sync Replica) set. What happens if all followers fall out of the ISR? How does Kafka handle such a situation?

How does Kafka handle message deduplication, and can Kafka guarantee exactly-once delivery semantics? What are the limitations of this approach?

Describe what happens internally when a Kafka broker crashes that is the leader for a partition. How is a new leader selected? Can data loss occur?

🚦 Kafka Performance and Scaling:
What are some real-world scenarios in which Kafka throughput suddenly degrades? How would you investigate and resolve the issue?

Kafka persists data to disk. Explain how Kafka achieves high throughput despite using disk-based storage.
