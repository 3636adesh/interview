##questions

1. Behavioral & Project-Based Questions
These often start the interview to gauge fit and experience.

Introduce yourself and walk through your current/previous projects (focus on your role, tech stack, challenges, and decisions like DB choice).
Why KPMG? Why did you leave your previous role?
Describe obstacles faced in a project and how you overcame them.
What are your key responsibilities in backend development? (e.g., API design, integration).

2. Core Java & OOP Concepts
Expect basics and mid-level questions; they test fundamentals.

What is Inheritance? Explain with an example.
Difference between Abstract Class and Interface.
Difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding.
What is a NullPointerException? How do you avoid it?
What are Java 8 features? (e.g., Streams, Lambdas).
What is a Functional Interface? Give an example.
Key differences between Java 8 and Java 11 (e.g., modules, HTTP client).
How do you handle exceptions in Java? Best practices (e.g., checked vs unchecked).
What is the difference between Runnable and Callable interfaces?
What is Concurrent Modification Exception? How does it occur and how to prevent it?

3. Collections & Data Structures
Common for backend efficiency discussions.

Difference between List and Set.
Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList.
What is a Collection in Java? Explain the framework hierarchy.
Explain the internal working of HashMap (hashing, buckets, collision resolution).
What is LinkedHashMap? What is TreeMap? Write code to demonstrate.
How do you ensure thread safety in collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap)?

4. Spring Boot & Frameworks
KPMG often asks about enterprise tools.

Difference between Spring and Spring Boot.
What is Dependency Injection? How does it work in Spring?
What does the @Transactional annotation do? What happens if an exception occurs during data insertion?
Describe your experience with Spring frameworks (e.g., Spring MVC, Hibernate).

5. Microservices, APIs & Architecture
Focus on scalable backend design.       

What is a REST API? Explain HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and their uses.
What is Microservices architecture? Pros/cons vs monolith.
What is Token Authentication (e.g., JWT)?
What is Agile Methodology? Your experience with it.

6. Databases & SQL
Often includes a query-writing task.

List two database connection properties in application.properties (e.g., spring.datasource.url, spring.datasource.username).
Write a SQL query to find the 2nd highest salary (include id, name, salary).
Write a SQL query joining three tables: employee (id, dept_id, name), department (dept_id, name), salary (emp_id, amount).

7. Coding & Problem-Solving
Prepare for live coding (e.g., on HackerRank or shared editor).

Write a program to reverse a string.
Given an array of integers {1,2,3,4,5}, find the second largest number.
Predict the output of code snippets (e.g., involving loops, exceptions, or collections).
Implement an interface (e.g., Building) in two classes (School, Hospital) and explain.
