Key SQL topics frequently tested include:

How to use different types of JOINs (INNER, LEFT, etc.) and explain their differences.

Aggregation queries: GROUP BY, HAVING, calculating averages, maximum/minimum values, and percentages.

Window functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), and their uses.

Subqueries: difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries, and when to use a CTE.

Data filtering and analysis: finding duplicates, deleting duplicates but keeping one, finding records in one table but not another.

Advanced problem-solving: identifying VIP users based on activity thresholds, calculating percentage success rates (e.g., of payment completions), daily activity streaks.

Query performance: understanding indexing, optimizing slow queries.


Miscellaneous: handling NULLs, case sensitivity, pivot/unpivot, running totals, a
